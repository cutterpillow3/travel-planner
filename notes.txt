Thank you for providing the directory structure for your project. Based on the structure you've shared, here’s how you would adjust file paths in your code to ensure everything works correctly when running the application on your local server.

### Provided Directory Structure

```
Documents/
│
├── database/
│   └── travel.db
│
├── docs/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── script.js
│   └── style.css
│
└── project_code/
    ├── db_connection.php
    ├── destinations.php
    ├── destination_details.php
    ├── trip_planner.php
    └── test_db.php
```

### Adjusting File Paths

1. **HTML File (`index.html`)**:
   - Update the paths to your JavaScript and CSS files in `index.html` to point to the `docs` directory correctly.
   - Ensure that any links to PHP files in the `project_code` directory are correctly referenced.

   Here’s how the updated `index.html` might look:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Sustainable Travel Planner</title>
       <meta name="description" content="Plan your sustainable travel adventures with our comprehensive travel planner.">
       <meta name="keywords" content="sustainable travel, eco-friendly, travel planner, destinations">
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- Corrected path to style.css -->
   </head>
   <body>
       <header>
           <h1>Sustainable Travel Planner</h1>
       </header>

       <main>
           <section id="destinations">
               <h2>Destinations</h2>
               <div id="destination-list">
                   <!-- Destination items will be populated here -->
               </div>
           </section>

           <section id="trip-planner">
               <h2>Trip Planner</h2>
               <div id="trip-form">
                   <label for="destination1">Destination 1:</label>
                   <select id="destination1" aria-label="Select first destination"></select>

                   <label for="destination2">Destination 2:</label>
                   <select id="destination2" aria-label="Select second destination"></select>

                   <label for="destination3">Destination 3:</label>
                   <select id="destination3" aria-label="Select third destination"></select>

                   <button id="plan-trip" class="button">Plan Trip</button>
               </div>
               <div id="trip-results"></div>
           </section>

           <div id="destination-details-container" class="details-container" style="display: none;">
               <!-- Destination details will be populated here -->
               <button id="close-details">Close</button>
           </div>

           <div id="loading-indicator" class="loading" style="display: none;">
               Loading...
           </div>
       </main>

       <script src="script.js"></script> <!-- Corrected path to script.js -->
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **JavaScript File (`script.js`)**:
   - In your `script.js`, if you are making calls to PHP scripts, ensure the paths are relative to where the HTML file is served. Since the PHP scripts are in the `project_code` directory, you will need to adjust the fetch URLs accordingly.

   Here’s an example of how you might modify the fetch calls in `script.js`:

   ```javascript
   fetch('project_code/destinations.php') // Updated path to destinations.php
   ```

   Similarly, update paths for other fetch calls to point to the correct PHP scripts:

   ```javascript
   fetch(`project_code/trip_planner.php?destinations=${destination1},${destination2},${destination3}`)
   fetch(detailsUrl) // This should be fine as it uses the full URL for the link
   ```

3. **PHP Files**:
   - In your PHP files, if you have any includes, make sure they are also correctly referenced based on the directory structure. For example, in `db_connection.php`, if you need to access the database file, you would reference it like this:

   ```php
   $db = new SQLite3('../database/travel.db'); // Adjust path to travel.db
   ```

### Running the Application
Once you have updated all the paths in your HTML, JavaScript, and PHP files, you can run your application using the PHP built-in server:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `docs` directory, where your `index.html` file is located:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/Documents/docs
   ```

2. Start the PHP built-in server:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. Open your web browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/index.html
   ```

### Conclusion
By ensuring that all file paths are correctly referenced based on your directory structure, you can run your PHP application locally without issues. If you encounter any specific problems or have further questions, feel free to ask!
